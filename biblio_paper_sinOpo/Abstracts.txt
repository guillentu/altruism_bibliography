Pro-Social Behavior In Rats Requires An Affective Motivation

The motivations behind rodent helping behavior are unclear. We hypothesize that helping
behavior is motivated by an affective state. To test this, we used a paradigm in which one rat can
help another by releasing him from a restrainer. Rats were left untreated or received an injection
of saline, midazolam (anxiolytic), or nadolol (peripherally acting sympatholytic). Midazolam but
not nadolol or saline blocked helping. However, midazolam-treated rats opened the restrainer to
access chocolate, showing that midazolam blocks helping through an effect on affect rather than
through sedation or the like. To determine the role of HPA reactivity, we measured the
corticosterone response to a trapped rat. Rats with the highest corticosterone responses evoked
by a trapped rat did not develop consistent helping behavior. Together, these results demonstrate
that rodent helping behavior is motivated by an affective state of anxiety and antagonized by
physiological stress.
